# Stepper-Motor-motion-duplicator
Read encoder of human movement of a wheel. Then make the same motion on a stepper motor.
I have very little Arduino experience. First I need to create a sketch that accelerates a stepper motor for x amount of steps, then a constant y number of steps and then deaccelerates for the same x number of steps. Then reverses the motor for the same x and y amounts.
Phase two is using an encoder to measure and store the movement created by a human, then use those encoder pulses to recreate the movement with a stepper motor. It will work both ways. 1)With x and y pulses programmed and 2)Emulating human movement.
